-- These define the co-rider units for mounts such as vanilla's 2307, Elephant Rider,
-- which have multiple co-riders besides the rider and the mount themselves. It works
-- analogously to how the mounts.txt file works and how mount items work. The combined,
-- full shape of the unit should have a #command "#coridermnr 'corider_id'" that points
-- to the ids defined here. When the unit is parsed by NationGen and polished, it will
-- map these corider ids into a number id that gets written into the .dm file. This id
-- mapping happens in NationGen.java, inside the handleCorider() function.
